# LARVa - Bridge LoongArch to RISC-V

This project is a proof-of-concept RISC-V emulator aiming at near-native
execution performance, currently targeting the LoongArch but may expand to
other architectures in the future.

The project is named after a popular but extremely difficult chart with the
same name, in the rhythm game *maimai*. Binary translation is hard, running such
logic in privileged mode is even harder; while I cannot play the *maimai*
chart at all, I do hope to manage the difficulty *here* somehow!
